I am working as a Posdoc in the Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory (SVCL), University of California, San Diego, advised by [Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D degree in the [Video, Image, and Sound Analysis Lab (VISAL)](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk), City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/). My research interests include crowd counting, pose estimation, and traffic congestion analysis.  

I received the M.Sc. degree in the School of Computer Science and the Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), supervised by [Prof. Qi Wang](http://crabwq.github.io), and B.Eng. degree at the Software Engineering School in Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.
